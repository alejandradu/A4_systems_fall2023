Bad1
commented out insert() -> all else worked
supposed to return INITIALIZATION_ERROR but returned SUCCESS - so it is 
initialized
** it is insert()

Bad2
assert failing means that temp and "a\na/x\na" ARE the same
it is correctly removing the entire tree from lines abive
it is not to_String()
** remove() - when it wanted to remove one child it removed both

Bad3
** insert
when we print it, it has not been inserted
