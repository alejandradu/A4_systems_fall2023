authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction
being reported to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used
no unauthorized sources of information.

Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

Helpful to learn how to debug and use gdb. Not fun. Tedious.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Was it fun?

Helpful to learn how to collaborate on a codebase and learn
to read another person's code. Not fun. Too much.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

We have detected no bugs. To clarify, we choose design option #2 for 
ft.c, in which each node has 2 separate fields for file and directory 
children. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate for Part 2's checker, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

No warnings for CheckerDT.C

Warnings for the dependencies of CheckerDT.C

MANY - REDO DOCSTRINGS?

For each of the five faulty BDT implementations required by Step
1.5, identify the function where there is a bug. You do not have to
identify the bug itself, only its location, but note that this must be
the location of the underlying error, which is not necessarily where
the error manifests itself or is "noticed" by the client.


      Executable         Function with the underlying error
===============================================================
         ./bdtBad1        insert
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad2        BDT_freeSubtree
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad3        BDT_addChild
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad4        BDT_strlenAccumulate
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad5        BDT_findNode
===============================================================

What are your critiques of the given DT implementations, as
specified in Step 2.5?
